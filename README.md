# Overview

These are typically done about a week or two before graduation. The purpose of the interviews is to give the students a chance to practice giving answers to technical questions and presenting themselves in a professional manner.

## Prep

First thing you will need to do is find a company that the interview will be for. This gives the students the opportunity to research the company before the interview and hopefully come up with questions to ask about the company during the interview. This also means the mentors doing the mock interviews will also need to read up on the company to at least give believable answers.

You will also need to create some sort of sign up sheet with all the available times to meet. Each interview usually lasts about 30 minutes but to be safe probably allot 45 minutes of time per interview just to make sure you don't have to rush interviews. At the same time give out the name of the company that you will be impersonating along with the interview guide.

## Interview

The interview itself will be broken up into 3 parts, the HR questions, Technical questions, and giving the student time to ask questions. After the official interview make sure you have a debriefing on what they did well, and what they could do better on. We found it works best to have 2 mentors in the interview one taking the role of HR and the other being the Technical lead.

### HR Questions

<details><summary>HR</summary>

Typically we have the HR mentor take the lead on the discussion and start by asking the student a few questions from this list, this should not take up a majority of the time so typically limit it to 3 questions.

- Tell us a little bit about yourself.
- Tell me about your experience working with your peers and mentors at DevMountain.
- How did you hear about our company, and why did you apply for this company.
- What do you think sets you apart from the other candidates applying for this job?
- If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?
- What do you expect from our company?
- How are you hoping to grow during your time with our company?

### Technical Questions

This should take up a majority of the time with the interview. With these questions we typically based the questions off how well the student had been doing in the course. Give them a few questions they can answer and at least one they can't. This gives them at least a little bit of confidence and it is also good to see how they handle a situation where they don't know the answer. Pick a few from each section then pick one from the toy problem section. The toy problem should be hard enough for them where they will have to think about it and can't just jump strait into code. The purpose of the white board problem is to see how they think, not if they can solve it.

Also this list is not the definitive list, feel free to use what ever.
